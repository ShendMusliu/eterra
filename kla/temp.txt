Model Alignment

Introduce a permanent userId for every account, refactor the role-assignment table to use it as PK while keeping cognitoSub optional, and add GSIs (e.g. byCognitoSub, byEmailLower) for quick lookups.
Schema Design

Extend your AppSync schema with a single user-data table keyed on USER#{userId} / PROFILE, embedding a student detail object first; capture required student fields, validation constraints, lifecycle flags, and set @auth rules so only the right roles can read/update.
Backend Operations

Implement CRUD mutations/queries for student data plus any backing Lambda logic (e.g. ensuring email uniqueness, linking to existing role assignments, handling pre-provisioned users).
Types & Codegen

Regenerate Amplify codegen so strongly-typed operations/models are available, then add any shared TS helpers (e.g. schema validators, DTO mappers) for frontend use.
Frontend Page

Build the admin student data page in React with react-hook-form + Zod, Tailwind/shadcn UI components, react-i18next strings: table/grid of students, filters, create/edit modal, optimistic updates, and proper error states.
Testing & Verification

Add unit/integration tests for the new AppSync/Lambda logic, UI component tests or Cypress smoke where feasible, and document manual QA steps (happy path, auth checks, invite → first login flow).
